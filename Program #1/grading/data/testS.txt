the

its
inscrutable
mysteries

not

like
most
bond

in
recent
years
,
some
of
the
stunts
are
so
outlandish
that
they
border
on
being
cartoonlike
.
a
heavy
reliance
on
cgi
technology
is
beginning
to
creep
into
the

the
film
makes
a

the
importance
of
the
musicians
in
creating

motown

in
its
ragged
,

it

be
a
page-turner

you
can't

viewers
willing

take

will
be
rewarded
with
two
of
the
year's
most
accomplished
and

1
the

a

energy

you
through
the
entire
85
minutes

1
like
the
film's
almost
anthropologically
detailed
realization
of
early-'80s
suburbia
,
it's
significant
without
being
overstated
.

1
while
mcfarlane's
animation
lifts
the
film
firmly
above
the
level
of
other
coming-of-age
films
.
.
.
it's
also
so
jarring
that
it's
hard
to
get
back
into
the
boys'
story
.

1
a
romantic
comedy
that
operates
by
the
rules
of
its

self-contained
universe

2
couples
,
2000

and
all
the
pabst

it's
the

digital-video
documentary

glimpse

the
film
overcomes
the
regular
minefield
of
coming-of-age
cliches
with
potent
doses
of
honesty
and
sensitivity
.

1
like
mike

win
any
points
for
originality
.
it
does
succeed
by
following
a
feel-good
formula
with
a
winning
style
,
and
by
offering
its
target
audience
of
urban
kids
some
welcome
role
models
and
optimism
.

1
enormously
likable
,
partly
because
it
is
aware

its

grasp
of

1
ray
liotta

jason
patric

some
of
their
best
work
in
their
underwritten
roles

but
don't
be
fooled
:
nobody
deserves
any
prizes
here
.

1
its
mysteries
are
transparently
obvious
,
and
it's
too
slowly
paced
to
be
a
thriller
.
[but
it's]
worth
recommending
because
of
two
marvelous
performances
by
michael
caine
and
brendan
fraser
.

1
the
film
is
faithful
to
what
one
presumes
are
the
book's
twin
premises
--
that
we
become
who
we
are
on
the
backs
of
our
parents
,
but
we
have
no
idea
who
they
were
at
our
age
;
and
that
time
is
a
fleeting
and
precious
commodity
no
matter
how
old
you
are
.

1
a
solidly
seaworthy
chiller
.

1
most

a
clever

captivating
romantic
comedy

a
welcome
pinch

tartness

1
the
seaside
splendor

shallow

beautiful
people
are
nice
to
look
at
while
you
wait
for
the
story
to
get
going
.

1
engagingly
captures
the
maddening
and
magnetic
ebb
and
flow
of
friendship

1
maybe
it's
just
because
this
past
year
has
seen
the
release
of
some
of
the
worst
film
comedies
in
decades
.
.

but
honestly

analyze
that
really
isn't

there
are

moments

the

his

add
up
to
mesmerize
you
.

1
the
film's
greatest
asset
is
how
much
it's
not
just
another
connect-the-dots
,
spy-on-the-run
picture
.

1
it's
one
of
the
saddest
films
i
have
ever
seen
that
still
manages
to
be
uplifting

not

sentimental

a
morbid
appeal

over-the-top

ostentatious

this

a

whether

the

as
adapted
by
kevin
molony
from
simon
leys'
novel
"
the
death
of
napoleon
"
and
directed
by
alan
taylor
,
napoleon's
journey
is
interesting
but
his
parisian
rebirth
is
stillborn

1
this
is
a
happy
throwback
to
the
time
when
cartoons
were
cinema's
most
idiosyncratic
form
instead
of
one
of
its
most
predictable
.

1
not
so
much
a
movie
as
a
picture
book
for
the
big
screen
.
this
isn't
my
favorite
in
the
series
,
still
i
enjoyed
it
enough
to
recommend
.

1
it
is
a
film
that
will
have
people
walking
out
halfway
through
,
will
encourage
others
to
stand
up
and
applaud
,
and
will
,
undoubtedly
,
leave
both
camps
engaged
in
a
ferocious
debate
for
years
to
come
.

1
troubling
and
powerful
.

1
with
youthful
high
spirits
,
tautou
remains
captivating
throughout
michele's
religious
and
romantic
quests
,
and
she
is
backed
by
a
likable
cast
.

1
much
of
the
movie's
charm
lies
in
the
utter
cuteness
of
stuart
and
margolo
.
their
computer-animated
faces
are
very
expressive
.

1
awkward
but
sincere
and
,
ultimately
,
it
wins
you
over
.

1
when
your
leading
ladies
are
a
couple
of
screen-eating
dominatrixes
like
goldie
hawn
and
susan
sarandon
at
their
raunchy
best
,
even
hokum
goes
down
easily
.

1
gets
under
the
skin
of
a
man
who
has
just
lost
his
wife
.

1
it
is
inspirational
in
characterizing
how
people
from
such
diverse
cultures
share
the
same
human
and
spiritual
needs
.

1
it's
fairly
self-aware
in
its
dumbness
.

1
the
film
hinges
on
its
performances
,
and
both
leads
are
up
to
the
task
.

1
the
movie
sticks
much
closer
to
hornby's
drop-dead
confessional
tone
than
the
film
version
of
high
fidelity
did
.

1
reinforces
the
often
forgotten
fact
of
the
world's
remarkably
varying
human
population
and
mindset
,
and
its
capacity
to
heal
using
creative
,
natural
and
ancient
antidotes
.

1
a
movie
for
11-year-old
boys
with
sports
dreams
of
their
own
and
the
preteen
girls
who
worship
lil'
bow
wow
.

1
a
clever
blend
of
fact
and
fiction
.

1
a
vivid
cinematic
portrait
.

1
it's
a
good
film
--
not
a
classic
,
but
odd
,
entertaining
and
authentic
.

1
happily
for
mr
.
chin
--
though
unhappily
for
his
subjects
--
the
invisible
hand
of
the
marketplace
wrote
a
script
that
no
human
screenwriter
could
have
hoped
to
match
.

a
compelling
journey
.
.
.
and
"
his
best
friend
remembers
"
is
up
there
with
the
finest
of
specials
.

1
the
ending
does
leave
you
unfulfilled
,
but
these
are
performances
to
enjoy
in
a
memorable
ensemble
piece
.

1

.
.
an
agreeable
time-wasting
device
--
but
george
pal's
low-tech
1960
version
still
rules
the
epochs
.

1
frida's
artistic
brilliance
is
undeniable
--
it's
among
the
most
breathtakingly
designed
films
i've
ever
seen
.

1
sharp
,
lively
,
funny
and
ultimately
sobering
film
.

1
a
worthy
tribute
to
a
great
humanitarian
and
her
vibrant
'co-stars
.
'

1
works
because
,
for
the
most
part
,
it
avoids
the
stupid
cliches
and
formulaic
potholes
that
befall
its
brethren
.

1
a
slick
,
well-oiled
machine
,
exquisitely
polished
and
upholstered
.

1
worth
the
effort
to
watch
.

1
hawke
draws
out
the
best
from
his
large
cast
in
beautifully
articulated
portrayals
that
are
subtle
and
so
expressive
they
can
sustain
the
poetic
flights
in
burdette's
dialogue
.

1
it's
as
close
as
we'll
ever
come
to
looking
through
a
photographer's
viewfinder
as
he
works
.

1
thoughtful
,
provocative
and
entertaining
.

1
enjoy
it
for
what
it
is
;
you
can
hate
yourself
later
.

1
a
real
story
about
real
people
living
their
lives
concerned
about
the
future
of
an
elderly
,
mentally
handicapped
family
member
.

1
a
fast-moving
and
remarkable
film
that
appears
destined
to
become
a
landmark
in
japanese
animation
.

1
.
.
.
a
sour
little
movie
at
its
core
;
an
exploration
of
the
emptiness
that
underlay
the
relentless
gaiety
of
the
1920's
.
.
.
the
film's
ending
has
a
"
what
was
it
all
for
?
"
feeling
to
it
,
but
like
the
1920's
,
the
trip
there
is
a
great
deal
of
fun
.

1
a
worthy
entry
into
a
very
difficult
genre
.

1
eight
crazy
nights
is
a
showcase
for
sandler's
many
talents
.

1
this
is
one
of
the
most
visually
stunning
and
thematically
moving
epics
in
recent
memory
,
and
in
spite
of
numerous
minor
flaws
,
scorsese's
best
in
more
than
a
decade
.

1
a
resonant
tale
of
racism
,
revenge
and
retribution
.

1
here
,
adrian
lyne
comes
as
close
to
profundity
as
he
is
likely
to
get
.

1
it's
a
beautifully
accomplished
lyrical
meditation
on
a
bunch
of
despondent
and
vulnerable
characters
living
in
the
renown
chelsea
hotel
.
.
.

1
zany
,
exuberantly
irreverent
animated
space
adventure
.

1
the
disarming
cornball
atmosphere
has
a
way
of
infecting
the
entire
crowd
as
the
film
rolls
on
.

1
the
story
,
like
life
,
refuses
to
be
simple
,
and
the
result
is
a
compelling
slice
of
awkward
emotions
.

1
sits
uneasily
as
a
horror
picture
.
.
.
but
finds
surprising
depth
in
its
look
at
the
binds
of
a
small
family
.

1
the
actors
are
so
terrific
at
conveying
their
young
angst
,
we
do
indeed
feel
for
them
.

1
in
adobo
,
ethnicity
is
not
just
the
spice
,
but
at
the
heart
of
more
universal
concerns
.

1
nothing
denis
has
made
before
,
like
beau
travil
and
nenette
et
boni
,
could
prepare
us
for
this
gory
,
perverted
,
sex-soaked
riff
on
the
cannibal
genre
.

1
greene
delivers
a
typically
solid
performance
in
a
role
that
is
a
bit
of
a
departure
from
the
noble
characters
he
has
played
in
the
past
,
and
he
is
matched
by
schweig
,
who
carries
the
film
on
his
broad
,
handsome
shoulders
.

1
.
.
.
does
such
a
fine
job
of
engulfing
you
in
its
world
and
allying
you
with
its
characters'
choices
,
good
and
ill
,
that
its
shortcomings
are
remembered
only
as
an
afterthought
.

1
marvelous
,
merry
and
,
yes
,
melancholy
film
.

1
the
way
coppola
professes
his
love
for
movies
--
both
colorful
pop
junk
and
the
classics
that
unequivocally
qualify
as
art
--
is
giddily
entertaining
.

1
.
.
.
a
haunting
vision
,
with
images
that
seem
more
like
disturbing
hallucinations
.

1
frailty
isn't
as
gory
or
explicit
.
but
in
its
child-centered
,
claustrophobic
context
,
it
can
be
just
as
frightening
and
disturbing
--
even
punishing
.

1
an
enchanting
film
that
presents
an
audacious
tour
of
the
past
and
takes
within
its
warm
embrace
the
bounties
of
cultural
artifacts
inside
st
.
petersburg's
hermitage
museum
.

1
the
powers
team
has
fashioned
a
comedy
with
more
laughs
than
many
,
no
question
.
but
this
time
there's
some
mold
on
the
gold
.

1
reign
of
fire
may
be
little
more
than
another
platter
of
reheated
aliens
,
but
it's
still
pretty
tasty
.

1
this
cheery
,
down-to-earth
film
is
warm
with
the
cozy
feeling
of
relaxing
around
old
friends
.

1
an
epic
of
grandeur
and
scale
that's
been
decades
gone
from
the
popcorn
pushing
sound
stages
of
hollywood
.

1
the
two
leads
chomp
considerably
more
scenery
with
their
acting
than
fire-breathing
monsters

with
their
breath
.
.
.

1
after
making
several
adaptations
of
other
writers'
work
,
armenian-canadian
director
atom
egoyan
broached
an
original
treatment
of
a
deeply
personal
subject
.

1
without
resorting
to
hyperbole
,
i
can
state
that
kissing
jessica
stein
may
be
the
best
same-sex
romance
i
have
seen
.

1
even
those
who
would
like
to
dismiss
the
film
outright
should
find
much
to
mull
and
debate
.

1
leave
it
to
rohmer
,
now
82
,
to
find
a
way
to
bend
current
technique
to
the
service
of
a
vision
of
the
past
that
is
faithful
to
both
architectural
glories
and
commanding
open
spaces
of
the
city
as
it
was
more
than
two
centuries
ago
.

1
thoughtful
,
even
stinging
at
times

and
lots
of
fun

1
one
of
the
most
haunting
,
viciously
honest
coming-of-age
films
in
recent

1
the
wwii
drama

well
plotted
,
visually
striking

filled
with
enjoyably
complex
characters

chicago

an
admirable

a
well-observed
and
disturbing
little
movie

1
everything
you
loved
about
it
in
1982
is
still
there
,
for
everybody
who
wants
to
be
a
kid
again
,
or
show
it
to
their
own
kids
.

1
there
is
a
kind
of
attentive
concern
that
hoffman
brings
to
his
characters
,
as
if
he
has
been
giving
them
private
lessons
,
and
now
it
is
time
for
their

its

[lawrence

all
over

dancing

running
,
sweating
,
mopping
his
face
and
generally
displaying
the
wacky
talent
that
brought
him
fame
in
the
first
place
.

there's

tremendous
energy
from
the

a
sense
of
playfulness
and
excitement
that
seems
appropriate

1
a
deep
and
meaningful
film

1
made
me
unintentionally
famous
as
the
queasy-stomached
critic
who
staggered
from
the
theater
and
blacked
out
in
the
lobby
.
but
believe
it
or
not
,
it's
one
of
the
most
beautiful
,
evocative
works
i've
seen
.

1
while
the
stoically
delivered
hokum
of
hart's
war
is
never
fun
,
it's
still
a
worthy
addition
to
the
growing
canon
of
post-saving
private
ryan
tributes
to
the
greatest
generation
.

1
writer/director
joe
carnahan's
grimy
crime
drama
is
a
manual
of
precinct
cliches
,
but
it
moves
fast
enough
to
cover
its
clunky
dialogue
and
lapses
in
logic
.

1
a
smart
,
witty
follow-up
.

1
building
slowly
and
subtly
,
the
film
,
sporting
a
breezy
spontaneity
and
realistically
drawn
characterizations
,
develops
into
a
significant
character
study
that
is
both
moving
and
wise
.

1
without
ever
becoming
didactic
,
director
carlos
carrera
expertly
weaves
this
novelistic
story
of
entangled
interrelationships
and
complex
morality
.

1
a
literate
presentation
that
wonderfully
weaves
a
murderous
event
in
1873
with
murderous
rage
in
2002
.

1
broomfield
turns
his
distinctive
'blundering'
style
into
something
that

really
help
clear
up

case

it's
refreshing
to
see
a
girl-power
movie
that
doesn't

huston

both
the

your
wildest
fantasies
about
being
a
different
kind
of

traveler

1
the
movie
is
beautiful
to
behold
and
engages
one
in
a
sense
of
epic
struggle
--
inner
and
outer
--
that's
all
too
rare
in
hollywood's
hastier
productions
.

garca
bernal

are
an
immensely
appealing
couple
,
and
even
though
their
story
is
predictable
,
you'll
want
things
to
work
out
.

1
at
a
time
when
half
the
so-called
real
movies
are
little
more
than
live-action
cartoons
,
it's
refreshing
to
see
a
cartoon
that
knows
what
it
is
,
and
knows
the
form's
history
.

1
seldahl's
barbara
is
a
precise
and
moving
portrait
of
someone
whose
world
is
turned
upside
down
,
first
by
passion
and
then
by
illness
.

like

it's
frustrating

likable

1
all
in
all
,
the
count
of

okay
,
but
it
is
surely
no

based
.

1
looking
aristocratic

luminous

careworn
in

exemplary
costumes

rampling

performance

pacino

brilliant
as
the
sleep-deprived
dormer

his

1
this

1
a

drama

1
for
the
most
part

it's
a
work
of
incendiary
genius

steering
clear
of
knee-jerk
reactions

quick
solutions

1
one
of
the
more
intelligent
children's
movies

hit
theaters
this

1
it's
a
bit
disappointing
that
it
only
manages
to
be
decent
instead
of
dead
brilliant
.

1
an
operatic
,
sprawling
picture
that's
entertainingly
acted
,
magnificently
shot
and
gripping
enough
to
sustain
most
of
its
170-minute
length

1
an
important
movie

a
reminder

the
power
of

to
move
us
and
to
make

the
